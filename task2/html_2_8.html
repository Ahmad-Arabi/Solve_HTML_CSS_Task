    <p><mark>Coding is the composition of sequences of instructions, called programs,</mark> that computers can follow 
        to perform tasks. It involves designing and implementing algorithms, step-by-step specifications of 
        procedures, by writing code in one or more programming languages. Programmers typically use high-level 
        programming languages that are more easily intelligible to human than machine code, which is directly 
        executed by the central processing unit. Proficient programming usually requires expertise in several 
        different subjects, including knowledge of the application domain, details of programming languages 
        and generic code libraries, specialized algorithms, and formal logic. Auxiliary tasks accompanying and 
        related to programuning include analyzing requirements, testing, debugging (investigating and fixing 
        problems), <u>implementation of build systems, and management of derived artifacts such as programs'
        machine code.</u>

        The first computer program is generally dated to 1843, when mathematician Ada Lovelace published an
        algorithm to calculate a sequence of Bernoulli numbers, intended to be carried out by Charles Babbage's
        Analytical Engine. However, Charles Babbage had already written his first program for the Analytical Engine
        in 1837

        In the 1880s, Herman Hollerith invented the concept of storing data in machine-readable form. Later
        a control panel (plug board) added to his 1906 Type I Tabulator allowed it to be programmed for different
        jobs, and by the late 1940s, unit record equipment such as the IBM 602 and IBM 604, were programumed by
        control panels in a similar way, as were the first electronic computers. However, with the concept of
        the stored-program computer introduced in 1949, both programs and data were stored and manipulated in
        the same way in computer memory.

        Programming is, quite literally, all around us. From the take-out we order, to the movies we stream,
        code enables everyday actions in our lives. Tech companies are no longer recognizable as just software
        companies â€” instead, they bring food to our door, help us get a taxi, influence outcomes in presidential
        elections, or act as a personal trainer.
